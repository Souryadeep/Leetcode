Solved by     : **Souryadeep Sen**  
Home page     : [My home page](https://github.com/Souryadeep)  
All solutions : Using C/C++ programming language.  
Source code   : [src](https://github.com/Souryadeep/Leetcode/tree/master/src)  
Headers       : [headers](https://github.com/Souryadeep/Leetcode/tree/master/include)  
Collaboration : I am open to collobaration. Please submit a pull request if there is a better way to solve the problem/there is a bug

## Motivation  

I created this repo to serve as a reference for others working on leetcode problems, and am working on documenting my approach to solving the problems, which I will publish on this page.  
There are always multiple ways to solve problems, as you will see on leetcode too.  
I have tried to add in some other best practices such as memory management.  
Disclaimer: These do not neccesarily represent the most optimum solution. I am open to collaboration, and feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to contribute to the repo.


## Usage  

Please see my documentation on installing gcc (compulsory) and other optional tools @ [Link](https://github.com/Souryadeep/k-r-exercise-solutions)  

Compiling the code on linux command line:  

	- For code with comments that mentions 'use with ...'
		- gcc -g -Wall -I../include program.c otherCFiles.c -o test -l(pthread/m/..)   
		- for C++ code, replace the gcc with g++  
		- -I../include is used to tell the compiler where the header files are  
		- other C Files will be in the src directory    
		- -l() is used to tell the linker to link a particular library, such as pthread, math (m) and so on  
		- -g is a debug flag, -Wall is to turn on warnings  
	- For code without the above comment
		- gcc -g -Wall program.c -o test -l(pthread/m/...)  

Executing the code on linux command line:  

	- With valgrind  
		- valgrind --leak-check=yes ./test  <cmdlineoptions>  
	- Without valgrind  
		- ./test <cmdlineoptions>
