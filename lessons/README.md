## NOTE

These lessons are in C++. Since the STL is so powerful, I decided to document some lessons using C++.  
The concepts can be implemented in C, but its better to explain in C++, to hide the nitty-gritty details of solving problems in C.  
Please reach out to me in case you want to discuss how to solve in C
